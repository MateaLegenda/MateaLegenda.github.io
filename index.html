        <h2>Mercedes</h2>
        <p>Mercedes-Benz may be best known for luxury cars, but the Silver Star marque also has a rich history of building some of the most impressive supercars this side of a Pagani – whose cars it also happens to power. With a deep involvement in motor racing of all sorts, it should come as no big surprise that Mercedes has translated its motorsport prowess into road-going supercars. But lots of automakers that regularly race don't necessarily produce the kind of extreme performance machines that Mercedes has.</p>
        <p>Here is top 5 Mercedes supercars ever:


        <h3>Mercedes-Benz ELK</h3>
        <p>The car designed by Antonio Paglia comes with a front fascia with a grille made of carbon fiber, flanked by blade-like LED lights, with their contours merging into one line that extends to the three-pointed star logo. Flare front and rear fenders set out a very low glasshouse.</p>
        <p>A star-like rear windscreen flows towards a back with a similar design like that at the front. The wheels, just like those of the IAA Concept, seem to be concave, but turn into perfectly flat discs when the car rolls to guarantee greater aerodynamics.For the racetrack version, Antonio Paglia added the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS racing advertising tapes, but also a towering rear air wing, a massive front splitter, racing wheels, a front grille painted in the PETRONAS green and a downforce-generating air diffuser.</p>

        <h4>Mercedes-Benz AMG GT R</h4>
        <p>The AMG GT R was developed to be a pure distillation of GT3 racing technology in streetable form. Strategic weight reduction, higher output, active aero, sport tires, and numerous performance innovations create a pure sports car that's more capable in every way, including the skill to thrill.</p>
        <p>The front-mid-engine/rear-transaxle layout delivers an ideal 47.3:52.7 front/rear weight balance. Transmitting massive power between them, a carbon fibre torque tube is more rigid yet some 9 kg lighter. The carbon fibre front fenders, roof, rear diffuser and underbody panels further slash weight.</p>
        <p>Grippy DINAMICA microsuede wraps the steering wheel and trims the Nappa leather seats. Console controls evoke the biturbo V8 powerplant, and invoke its power. From the sound system to the structural braces concealed below, even the weight-saving measures assert that AMG never takes control lightly.</p>

       <h5>Mercedes-Benz 2040 W196R Streamliner</h5>
       <p>
2040, speed limit breaks by opening exclusive road for autonomus driving cars. This project suggests high-speed GT cars that have more simple procedures compared to an airplane and can be used in on any weather conditions. Mercedes-Benz 2040 W196R Streamliner - Future Mercedes SuperCar.</p>
<p>Utilizing that design, the 2040 Streamliner is powered by a dual jet engine system rather than a traditional combustion system.</p>
<p>The design features a retro-futuristic concept, with a low profile and tightly enclosed cabin to provide for more efficiency for air resistance.</p>

        <h6>Mercedes-Benz AMG R50 Hypercar</h6>
        <p>Before anything, let’s start with what we have previously heard. Here are the highlights: 1.6-liter turbo V6 taken from the W07 Hybrid Formula 1 car, an energy-recovery system (as in KERS), 220-plus mph (354 km/h), between 1,000 and 1,500 horsepower, and a €4 million ($4.45 million) projected retail price. On top of what evo has reported back in August, Automobile Mag follows up with similarly unconfirmed details about the alleged hypercar.</p>

<h7> Mercedes-Benz SL GTR </h7>
<p>The Mercedes SL GTR concept features a pure-bred race car chassis, pushrod suspension, carbon ceramic brakes, magnesium wheels, Pirelli P-ZERO racing tires, and a nismo designed 5.5 litre v8 race engine from the Nissan GTR GT1 race car… Yeah that’s right, at the heart of this Mercedes is a 690 horsepower Nissan-designed V8 which revs to 9,500 rpm.</p>
<p>It sounds odd, but Mercedes and Nissan have just recently thrashed out a deal to design and manufacture a number of smaller-displacement engines jointly. I suppose it’s no great stretch of the imagination to expect that in the coming years they might co-develop some more high-powered units.

The teardrop shape of the Mercedes-Benz SL GTR concept is designed to emulate that of a Le Mans racer. The bodywork is carbon fiber, and it is wrapped around a strong passenger compartment made from the same stuff.</p>
